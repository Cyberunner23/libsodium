libsodium-CMake
============

This is a "CMakeified" version of libsodium which can be found [here](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) with the official documentation [here](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/).
This "CMakeification" is made with libsodium version 1.0.3. This is not the best way to do this but it works... mostly... If libsodium updates and I miss it, just tell me and I will update also.
